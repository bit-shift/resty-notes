ReSTy Notes

Summary
-------
Note-handling tool, currently still in development.

Fuller README will be forthcoming when more of the tool is done.

Plan
----
Loose plan is as follows:
  - Stores to/reads from a minimal reST-like format (**DONE**)
  - Finds titles by fuzzy-matching (**DONE**) or creates a new entry
    if no match (**NOT DONE**)
  - Save current note block as it's typed, for resilience against system
    crash or forgetting to save. (**NOT DONE**)
  - Has a minimal GUI for above features, so as to be able to be bound
    to a hotkey for quick access (**NOT DONE**)
